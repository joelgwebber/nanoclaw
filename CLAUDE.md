# NanoClaw

Personal Claude assistant. See [README.md](README.md) for philosophy and setup. See [docs/REQUIREMENTS.md](docs/REQUIREMENTS.md) for architecture decisions.

## Quick Context

Single Node.js process that connects to WhatsApp, routes messages to Claude Agent SDK running in containers (Linux VMs). Each group has isolated filesystem and memory.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/index.ts` | Orchestrator: state, message loop, agent invocation |
| `src/channels/whatsapp.ts` | WhatsApp connection, auth, send/receive |
| `src/ipc.ts` | IPC watcher and task processing |
| `src/router.ts` | Message formatting and outbound routing |
| `src/config.ts` | Trigger pattern, paths, intervals |
| `src/container-runner.ts` | Spawns agent containers with mounts |
| `src/task-scheduler.ts` | Runs scheduled tasks |
| `src/db.ts` | SQLite operations |
| `groups/{name}/CLAUDE.md` | Per-group memory (isolated) |
| `container/skills/agent-browser.md` | Browser automation tool (available to all agents via Bash) |

## Skills

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `/setup` | First-time installation, authentication, service configuration |
| `/customize` | Adding channels, integrations, changing behavior |
| `/debug` | Container issues, logs, troubleshooting |
| `/update` | Pull upstream NanoClaw changes, merge with customizations, run migrations |
| `/add-workflowy` | Add WorkFlowy integration for outlining, tasks, and note-taking |
| `/add-readeck` | Add Readeck integration for bookmark management and read-it-later |
| `/qodo-pr-resolver` | Fetch and fix Qodo PR review issues interactively or in batch |
| `/get-qodo-rules` | Load org- and repo-level coding rules from Qodo before code tasks |

## Development

Run commands directly—don't tell the user to run them.

```bash
npm run dev          # Run with hot reload
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript
./container/build.sh # Rebuild agent container
```

Service management:
```bash
# macOS (launchd)
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw  # restart

# Linux (systemd)
systemctl --user start nanoclaw
systemctl --user stop nanoclaw
systemctl --user restart nanoclaw
```

## Updating Agent Runner Code

The agent runner source at `/app/src` is bind-mounted from `data/sessions/main/agent-runner-src/`. This allows runtime compilation without rebuilding the container.

**For source code changes** (adding MCP servers, modifying logic):
```bash
# 1. Edit files in container/agent-runner/src/
# 2. Sync to bind mount
./scripts/update-agent-source.sh
# 3. Restart service
systemctl --user restart nanoclaw  # Linux
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw  # macOS
```

**For dependency changes** (package.json, system packages):
```bash
./container/build.sh  # Full rebuild required
systemctl --user restart nanoclaw
```

### Container Build Cache

The container buildkit caches aggressively. `--no-cache` alone does NOT invalidate COPY steps. To force a clean rebuild:
```bash
docker builder prune -af
./container/build.sh
```
